Extract the values of a given Property From an Array of Objects

An experienced JavaScript should have a proper working knowledge of arrays and objects because these data structures are heavily used in modern JavaScript development. By giving this coding challenge, the interviewers want to see the developer’s approach for working with arrays and objects.

The following can be the input.

let input = [
  { name: "John", age: 21, city: "New York" },
  { name: "Mike", age: 28, city: "Moscow" },
  { name: "Danny", age: 30, city: "London" },
  { name: "Lisa", age: 26, city: "Paris" },
  { name: "Sophie", age: 19, city: "Berlin" },
];

For this challenge, the value of the “name” property from every object should be extracted and stored in an array. The output should be like the following: 

["John", "Mike", "Danny", "Lisa", "Sophie"];
